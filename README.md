### Motivation
Mental Health awareness is becoming more and more prevalent in today's culture as society is learning to focus more on it. Everyone experiences stress, anxiety, or even depression at least once in a while. Keeping track of negative as well as positive emotions can help find triggers and therefore prevent certain mental health problems.

### Project Goals
Our web application will...
* let users sign up and log in
* display the current date, weather, and an inspirational quote on a homepage
* prompt users with questions about their current mental state and let them add comments to each entry
* display all entries in an overview table
* display mood states of all entries in a graph
* offer resources to watch, listen, and read in a discover section
